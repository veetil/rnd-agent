We help teams build truly model-agnostic, long-running agents that
Run reliably over days/weeks (checkpointing + auto-restart)


Call external tools with high success rates


Learn on your proprietary data (your agent, not a shared one)


Optimize for concrete outcomes via an RL-tuned feedback loop (PPO/DPO/GRPO)


Coordinate multiple agents in a workflow—agents know each other’s state


Maintain memory across complex orchestrations


Seamlessly switch underlying LLMs and port finetuned knowledge when you upgrade or change providers


Why Model Portability Matters
Finetuning lock-in: Many frontier models don’t support customer finetuning—teams either buy a sub-optimal model or use prompt-injection hacks.


Upgrade risk: When your LLM provider rolls out a new version (“o3→o4”), you lose all your custom tuning—forcing expensive retraining.


Vendor lock-in: AWS, Azure, etc. offer unified APIs, but 80% of teams call APIs directly. They need a lightweight, open-source adapter layer to carry learning forward.
