# IdeaCode Website Phase 2: Context Capture

## Project Background

IdeaCode is a platform that enables developers to build multi-agent AI systems. The website serves as the primary marketing and information hub for the platform. Phase 1 of the website implementation established the core structure, branding, and content. Phase 2 focuses on enhancing the user experience through interactive components, animations, and optimized user journeys.

## Project Goals

1. **Enhance User Engagement**: Create a more interactive and engaging experience that encourages exploration and deeper understanding of IdeaCode's capabilities.

2. **Improve Information Accessibility**: Make complex technical information more accessible to different audience segments through progressive disclosure and persona-specific pathways.

3. **Optimize Conversion Paths**: Create clear, contextual pathways for different user personas to guide them toward appropriate conversion actions.

4. **Modernize Visual Experience**: Implement subtle animations and micro-interactions that enhance the perceived quality and modernity of the platform.

5. **Improve Mobile Experience**: Optimize the mobile navigation and interaction experience to better serve users on smaller screens.
