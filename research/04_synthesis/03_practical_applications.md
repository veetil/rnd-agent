- Use color coding to differentiate key capabilities (portability, orchestration, memory, reliability)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for code examples and technical diagrams

### 2. Typography Recommendations

- Use a clean, modern sans-serif for headlines and UI elements
- Consider a monospace font for code examples and technical specifications
- Maintain clear hierarchy with distinct heading styles

### 3. Illustration Style

- Develop a consistent illustration style for technical concepts
- Create visual metaphors for key differentiators:
  - Model Portability: Agents moving between different platforms
  - Orchestration: Conductor coordinating multiple agents
  - Memory Management: Persistent storage across workflows
  - Reliability: Self-healing or continuous operation visuals

### 4. UI Component Recommendations

- Code snippet displays with syntax highlighting
- Interactive architecture diagrams
- Comparison tables for competitive features
- Performance metric visualizations
- Step-by-step workflow illustrations

## Implementation Priorities

Based on our research, we recommend prioritizing these elements for the website revamp:

### Phase 1: Core Messaging and Structure
1. Homepage redesign with clear value proposition
2. Model Portability feature page
3. Technical Architecture overview
4. Initial documentation structure

### Phase 2: Technical Depth and Validation
1. Multi-Agent Orchestration feature page
2. Expanded documentation
3. Technical blog series (first 2-3 articles)
4. Initial case studies

### Phase 3: Audience-Specific Content
1. Industry solution pages
2. Business-focused messaging sections
3. Additional case studies
4. Interactive demos and tools

This phased approach ensures the most critical elements are addressed first while building toward a comprehensive website that serves all audience needs.
