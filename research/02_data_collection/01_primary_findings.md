## Developer Pain Points

Developers face several critical challenges when building, orchestrating, and managing AI agents:

### Orchestration Complexity
- Integrating and managing multiple agents presents challenges in task coordination
- Workflow design and robust error handling remain difficult
- Scaling agents to handle complex, cross-functional tasks introduces friction

### Memory Management
- AI agents need to retain context across long conversations or workflows
- Existing tools often lack efficient, scalable memory solutions
- Storing, retrieving, and updating both short-term and long-term context remains cumbersome
- Poor memory management leads to brittle user experiences or excessive system resource usage

### Model Portability
- Moving agents between different infrastructures or switching AI foundation models is difficult
- Proprietary APIs, lack of standardized interfaces, and differing model behaviors create friction
- Interoperability across ecosystems is a persistent pain point

### Customization vs. Usability
- Ready-to-deploy agents are easy to use but limit customization
- Building custom agents for complex use cases increases development overhead
- Advanced expertise requirements slow time-to-market

### Monitoring and Debugging
- Observability tools for agent workflows, state tracking, and debugging are still maturing
- Diagnosing failures or optimizing agent policies is labor-intensive compared to traditional software
