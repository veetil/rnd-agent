1. Developers Building AI Agents
Why It’s #1

    Severe, Recurring Pain: Building robust agentic workflows—from multi-agent orchestration to memory management—remains a labyrinth of bespoke code, brittle integrations, and ad-hoc testing.

    Tooling Gaps: No one platform offers end-to-end support (planning → memory → orchestration → testing)

    Market Growth: Developer tools spend is booming—from USD 6.61 B in 2024 to an estimated USD 22.6 B by 2033 (CAGR 14.5%)

    Longevity Factors: As agentic workflows grow in complexity, startups that anchor themselves in modular, trust-audited “agent platforms” will ride waves of new use cases (finance, hiring, marketing) for years to come.

Here’s a step-by-step LinkedIn outreach sequence—grounded in best practices and designed to rapidly build rapport while validating the “Developers Building AI Agents” pain point. Each phase includes a messaging template and rationale, with citations to industry sources.

Summary:
To validate our hypothesis with busy AI-agent developers, we’ll optimize our own profile, send a highly personalized connection request, warm up with engagement, then deliver a “value-first” outreach that surfaces their deepest orchestration/memory pain. A concise survey or call invitation follows, ensuring high reply rates without spamming. This multi-touch approach balances authenticity with urgency, yielding up to 55 % response and 15 % meeting rates when done right.
1. Prepare & Optimize Your Profile

Before outreaching, make your profile instantly credible to AI-agent builders.

    Professional headline & summary emphasizing your mission (e.g. “Building modular AI-agent platforms for seamless orchestration”).

    Featured content: pin one case study or blog post on agent workflows.

    SSI/Engagement: improve your Social Selling Index by posting 1–2 relevant updates per week
