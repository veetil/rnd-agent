   - Test responsive behavior across device sizes
   - Verify accessibility compliance

2. **Interaction Testing:**
   - Test hover states, animations, and transitions
   - Verify form validation and submission
   - Test interactive elements like filters or tabs

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Test load time and performance metrics
   - Verify optimization of images and assets
   - Test animation performance on lower-end devices

4. **Conversion Testing:**
   - Test CTA visibility and interaction
   - Verify form submission and error handling
   - Test analytics tracking implementation

### Technical Stack Recommendations

For both alternatives, we recommend:

1. **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with React for component-based architecture
2. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with minimal CSS
3. **Animation:** Framer Motion for performant animations
4. **Form Handling:** React Hook Form for lightweight form validation
5. **Analytics:** Simple analytics integration for conversion tracking
6. **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library for component testing

### Responsive Design Considerations
